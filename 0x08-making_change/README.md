This interview algorithm project uses a given pile of coins of different values and evaluates the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

* Write a function in Python `def makeChange(coins, total)` that calculates the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total with a given pile of different-valued coins

### test_files
The test_files/ directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally.
